# Homepage

Its just a collection of Links and things that I am interested in.

Still working in progress.

Milestones:

1. Article need to be posted, "Test"-Articles exists already but there is no link in homepage to it. But first gotta make a parser for the article it self and a program to be able to update the value in Homepage-html-file.
2. "Some Infos About Me"-Part need to be able to read data from https://aboutme-api-jj5o.onrender.com/ , but gotta make a bot first to keep the link active while its free one from render.
3. "Things I like"-Part still on planning part, while I still have no idea what to do there other than showing my playlist from spotify and all the current fanfics from webnovel.
